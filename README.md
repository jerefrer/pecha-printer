# Pecha Printer

A little Rails app to offer an easy frontend for [generate-printable-pecha](https://github.com/jerefrer/generate-printable-pecha), a small python lib that turns a single-page pecha PDFs into an A3 or A4 PDF for printing pages 3 by 3, properly ordered so that you just have to cut twice, put one stack on top of the other, and have your pecha ready.
